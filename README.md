### Welcome!
This github page functions as the repository for coding projects I've worked on both personally and as part of coding courses I've attended. Please explore and get in touch if there's a project that interests or inspires you!

### A little bit about me üîßü•æ‚öõÔ∏è
After studying physics at university I've spent the last few years working in science and engineering designing, building and comissioning a variety of diagnostics for experimental studies. When I'm not trying to think of the next requirement needed for a particular design to function at its best I'll have spanner in hand and be in the workshop. A good diagnostic is nothing without its data though so I've also developed Python codes to analyse output data to confirm it meets expectations and will be useful to researchers.

When not in work my main hobby is hiking though it was only late in 2022 that I conquered my first of two Scottish munros with more to come in 2023!
